  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Cocoa is a major perennial cash crop cultivated for its beans, which are
    processed into cocoa powder, butter, chocolate, and other confectionery
    products. It is one of the most important export crops in tropical regions
    and a key source of income for millions of smallholder farmers.
  </p>

<p>
    Cocoa farming supports rural livelihoods, employment creation, and
    international trade. With proper farm management, pest control, post-harvest
    handling, and value addition, cocoa offers long-term income and strong
    agribusiness opportunities.

  <h2>Production Systems (Overview)</h2>
  <p>
    Cocoa is grown mainly under smallholder and commercial plantation systems.
    Farms are often established under shade trees and integrated with other
    crops. Sustainable practices such as pruning, soil fertility management,
    and integrated pest management improve yield and tree longevity.

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Oil palm is a high-yielding perennial crop cultivated for palm oil and
    palm kernel oil, which are widely used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
    biofuels, and industrial products. It is one of the most productive oil
    crops globally and a major contributor to rural employment and national
    economies.
  </p>

<p>
    Oil palm farming supports smallholders, cooperatives, and large-scale
    plantations. With proper nursery management, plantation care, processing,
    and market access, oil palm offers long-term income and strong value-chain
    opportunities.

  <h2>Production Systems (Overview)</h2>
  <p>
    Oil palm is grown under smallholder, outgrower, and commercial plantation
    systems. While smallholders often manage mixed or medium-scale farms,
    commercial plantations focus on large-scale mechanized production and
    integrated processing facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crop thrives in humid tropical environments with well-distributed
    rainfall. Proper soil management, fertilization, and harvesting schedules
    are critical for high yields and oil quality.

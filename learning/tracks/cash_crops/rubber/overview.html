  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is a perennial industrial tree crop cultivated
    primarily for its latex, which is processed into natural rubber used in
    automotive, medical, construction, and consumer goods industries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rubber plantations have a long economic lifespan, typically producing latex
    for 20–30 years after establishment. Although initial investment and gestation
    periods are long, rubber offers stable, recurring income once tapping begins.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crop plays a critical role in rural industrialization, employment creation,
    and export-oriented agro-processing, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions.

  <h2>Production Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Rubber is cultivated under smallholder, estate, and outgrower plantation
    systems. Production requires careful land preparation, nursery management,
    planting density control, and long-term maintenance before latex tapping begins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sustainable practices such as soil fertility management, proper tapping
    techniques, and disease control are essential for yield stability and tree
    longevity.
  </p>

  <h2>Industrial Processing & Quality Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Latex harvested from rubber trees is processed into various forms including
    cup lump, sheet rubber, and technically specified rubber (TSR). Processing
    quality directly affects industrial usability and market value.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compliance with grading, hygiene, and international quality standards is
    critical for accessing industrial buyers and export markets.

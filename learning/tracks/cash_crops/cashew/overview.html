<section class="card">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Cashew (Anacardium occidentale) is a high-value perennial tree crop cultivated
    primarily for its edible nuts and valuable by-products used in food,
    pharmaceutical, and industrial applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cashew is one of the most important export-oriented crops in tropical regions.
    It supports millions of smallholder farmers while supplying raw materials
    for domestic processing industries and international markets.
  </p>

  <p>
    With proper orchard management, post-harvest handling, processing, and market
    access, cashew offers strong profitability, employment creation, and long-term agribusiness opportunities.

  <h2>Production Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Cashew is produced under smallholder, cooperative, and commercial plantation
    systems. Smallholder farmers dominate primary production, while cooperatives,
    processors, and exporters drive aggregation and value addition.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crop is well-suited to marginal soils and dry conditions, making it an
    important livelihood option in semi-arid regions. Sustainable practices such
    as pruning, soil fertility management, and pest control significantly improve
    yield and nut quality.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Processing & Quality Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Cashew nuts require careful post-harvest handling and processing to meet food
    safety and export quality standards. Processing includes drying, shelling,
    grading, roasting, and packaging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quality control directly affects market price and access to international
    buyers. Value addition through local processing significantly increases income
    and employment opportunities.

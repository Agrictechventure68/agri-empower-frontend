  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Avocado is a high-value perennial cash crop cultivated for its nutritious
    fruits, oil content, and growing demand in local and international markets.
    It is widely used for fresh consumption, food processing, cosmetics, and
    export-oriented agribusiness. Avocado farming offers long-term income
    opportunities, especially when managed as a commercial orchard enterprise.
  </p>

  <p>
    With proper variety selection, orchard management, and post-harvest handling,
    avocado production can serve both domestic markets and export value chains,
    making it a strategic crop for agripreneurs and commercial farmers.

  <h2>Production Systems (Overview)</h2>
  <p>
    Avocado can be grown under smallholder, mixed farming, or commercial orchard
    systems. Smallholders may intercrop avocado with legumes or vegetables during
    early growth stages, while commercial farms establish dedicated orchards for
    long-term production.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although avocado is often rain-fed, supplemental irrigation significantly
    improves flowering, fruit set, and fruit quality, especially in dry seasons.

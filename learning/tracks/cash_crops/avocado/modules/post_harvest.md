🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
This level introduces learners to basic pest awareness, disease recognition, and soil care in avocado production.
Common Avocado Pests
At beginner level, farmers should learn to identify visible pests:
Grasshoppers – chew leaves and young shoots
Caterpillars – cause leaf holes and defoliation
Fruit flies – damage developing fruits
Ants – often associated with sap-sucking insects
Common Avocado Diseases
Beginner farmers should recognize common symptoms:
Root rot – yellowing leaves, wilting, poor growth
Leaf spot diseases – brown or black spots on leaves
Anthracnose – dark lesions on fruits and leaves
Basic Soil Health Knowledge
Avocado prefers well-drained soil
Waterlogged soil causes root diseases
Healthy soil supports strong roots and disease resistance
Basic Prevention Practices
Avoid planting in flooded or poorly drained land
Use healthy seedlings
Remove visibly diseased branches
Keep farm clean and weed-free
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Awareness, identification, and basic prevention


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
This level focuses on control methods, prevention planning, and soil fertility improvement.
Pest Management Practices
Regular farm scouting to detect pests early
Manual removal of pests where possible
Use of approved organic or chemical pesticides
Avoid excessive pesticide use
Disease Management Strategies

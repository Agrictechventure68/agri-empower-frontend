🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
This level introduces avocado production to new farmers with little or no prior experience.
Overview of Avocado Production
Avocado is a perennial fruit tree grown for its nutritious fruits. It is suitable for smallholder farmers and can later develop into a long-term commercial enterprise.
Climate & Environmental Requirements
Grows best in warm tropical to subtropical climates
Requires moderate rainfall (well-distributed)
Sensitive to waterlogging and extreme drought
Site Selection
Well-drained loamy or sandy-loam soils
Gentle slopes preferred to prevent water stagnation
Avoid flood-prone or clay-heavy soils
Planting Materials
Seed-grown plants (for learning purposes)
Grafted seedlings recommended for better yield and early fruiting
Basic Land Preparation
Clear land manually or mechanically
Mark planting points
Dig planting holes before the rainy season
Planting Practices
Plant at the onset of rains
Place seedlings upright and firm soil around roots
Apply light mulching after planting
Basic Farm Care
Regular watering during establishment
Manual weeding around seedlings
Protect young plants from animals
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Target Audience: Beginner farmers, trainees, youth entrants

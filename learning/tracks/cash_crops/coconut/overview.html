<section class="card">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a highly versatile perennial tree crop cultivated
    for its nuts, water, oil, fiber, and other by-products used across food,
    cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a key industrial raw material with strong export potential and supports
    smallholder livelihoods as well as large-scale agro-industrial enterprises.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper plantation management, post-harvest handling, processing, and value
    addition enable coconut to provide sustainable income, employment, and
    market opportunities at local, national, and international levels.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Processing & Quality Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Coconut products such as oil, copra, desiccated coconut, and fiber require
    careful post-harvest handling and processing to meet food safety and
    export quality standards. Value addition maximizes income and employment
    potential across the value chain.

  <h2>Production Systems (Overview)</h2>
  <p>
    Coconut is grown under smallholder, mixed farming, and commercial
    plantation systems. Smallholders often integrate coconut with
    livestock or intercrops, while commercial plantations focus on
    uniform spacing, mechanization, and large-scale processing linkages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coconut thrives in coastal and humid tropical zones. Although
    generally rain-fed, irrigation and soil fertility management improve
    nut yield, quality, and long-term productivity.

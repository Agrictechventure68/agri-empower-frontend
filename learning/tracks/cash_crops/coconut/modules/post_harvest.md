# Coconut Post-Harvest Handling & Storage

This module guides learners in proper harvesting, handling, and storage
techniques to maintain coconut quality and reduce losses.

---

## FOUNDATION LEVEL  
### Harvesting Practices
- Harvest mature coconuts (brown coconuts for copra, green for water)
- Use safe tools and techniques
- Avoid damaging the tree or fruits

### Handling After Harvest
- Handle coconuts carefully to prevent shell cracking
- Avoid dropping coconuts on hard surfaces
- Collect fruits promptly after harvesting

### Basic Storage
- Short-term storage in shaded, ventilated areas
- Keep coconuts off damp ground
- Stack loosely to prevent pressure damage

> **Curriculum Level:** Foundation

## INTERMEDIATE LEVEL  
### Improved Harvesting Techniques
- Scheduled harvesting based on maturity indicators
- Use of climbing aids or pole harvesters
- Segregation by intended use (copra, water, or oil)

### Post-Harvest Handling
- Cleaning and brushing off dirt and debris
- Grading coconuts based on size and quality
- Sorting for market or processing

### Storage Improvements
- Medium-term storage in covered, ventilated areas
- Use of bamboo racks or slatted platforms
- Controlled humidity for coconut water preservation

> **Curriculum Level:** Intermediate

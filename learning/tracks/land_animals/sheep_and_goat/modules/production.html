🐑🐐 SHEEP & GOAT PRODUCTION

Sheep and goats are hardy small ruminants widely raised for meat, milk, skin,
manure, and income. They are suitable for smallholder, semi-commercial, and
commercial systems due to their adaptability, fast reproduction, and market demand.

This module covers sheep and goat production across all learning levels.

## FOUNDATION LEVEL  
### Introduction to Sheep and Goat Production

#### Importance of Sheep and Goats
- Source of meat, milk, skin, and manure
- Low start-up capital compared to large ruminants
- Suitable for rural and peri-urban farming
- High reproductive rate and fast turnover

#### Common Breeds
**Sheep:**
- Yankasa
- West African Dwarf (WAD)
- Balami
- Uda

**Goats:**
- West African Dwarf (WAD)
- Red Sokoto (Maradi)
- Sahel Goat
- Boer (improved meat breed)

#### Production Systems
- Extensive (free-range)
- Semi-intensive
- Intensive (confined system)

#### Basic Housing
- Raised or well-drained floor
- Protection from rain, sun, and predators
- Proper ventilation
- Clean water access

#### Basic Feeding
- Natural pasture
- Crop residues
- Browse plants
- Clean water always available

## INTERMEDIATE LEVEL  
### Improved Management Practices

#### Housing and Environment
- Separate pens for age and sex
- Kidding/lambing pens
- Regular cleaning and waste removal

#### Feeding and Nutrition
- Forage improvement (legumes, fodder grasses)
- Supplementation with concentrates
- Mineral licks and salt blocks
- Feeding according to physiological stage:
  - Growing
  - Pregnant
  - Lactating

#### Breeding Management
- Selection of healthy breeding stock
- Controlled mating
- Heat detection
- Breeding ratios (1 male : 20–30 females)

#### Routine Health Care
- Deworming schedules
- Vaccination programs
- External parasite control
- Observation for early signs of illness

## ADVANCED LEVEL  
### Productivity and Farm Optimization

#### Genetic Improvement
- Crossbreeding strategies
- Avoiding inbreeding
- Performance record keeping

#### Intensive Production Systems
- Zero-grazing or cut-and-carry
- Feed formulation
- Water management

#### Reproduction Efficiency
- Estrus synchronization (basic understanding)
- Improved kidding/lambing intervals
- Neonatal care for kids and lambs

#### Record Keeping
- Breeding records
- Growth performance
- Health treatments
- Mortality and sales records



## SPECIALIZATION LEVEL  
### Commercial and Enterprise-Level Production

#### Commercial Farm Design
- Space planning and stocking density
- Biosecurity-oriented layout
- Waste and manure management

#### Feed Business Integration
- On-farm fodder production
- Feed cost optimization
- Seasonal feed planning

#### Climate-Smart Practices
- Heat stress management
- Drought-resilient forage systems
- Sustainable grazing management

#### Market-Oriented Production
- Meat yield optimization
- Weight gain monitoring
- Preparing animals for market demand

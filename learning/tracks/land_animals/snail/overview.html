  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Snail farming, also known as heliciculture, is a sustainable and low-risk
    livestock enterprise suitable for small-scale and commercial farmers.
    Snails are easy to manage, require minimal space, and feed on readily
    available plant materials. Snail meat is rich in protein, low in fat,
    and highly demanded for its nutritional and medicinal value.

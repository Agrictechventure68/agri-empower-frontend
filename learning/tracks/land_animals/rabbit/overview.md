 Rabbit farming is a low-cost and fast-growing livestock enterprise suitable
    for smallholder, backyard, and commercial farmers. Rabbits are highly prolific,
    converting feed efficiently into quality meat, and require minimal space.
    They are valued for their lean meat, breeding potential, and manure for crop
    production.

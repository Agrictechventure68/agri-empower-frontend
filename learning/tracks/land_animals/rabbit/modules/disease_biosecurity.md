🐇 Rabbit Farming – Disease & Biosecurity


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL
At the foundation level, learners are introduced to basic rabbit health management and biosecurity principles.
Common Rabbit Diseases
Coccidiosis: Digestive tract infection causing diarrhea
Pasteurellosis (Snuffles): Respiratory disease
Myxomatosis: Viral disease causing swelling and lethargy
External parasites: Fleas, mites, and lice
Biosecurity Basics
Keep rabbits away from stray animals
Quarantine new stock for 2–3 weeks
Limit visitor contact with animals
Daily Health Checks
Observe appetite and behavior
Check for nasal/eye discharge
Inspect fur and skin for parasites
Hygiene & Sanitation
Clean cages daily
Remove feces and soiled bedding
Provide fresh drinking water
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Entry-level rabbit health awareness


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
At this level, learners focus on preventive measures, vaccination, and early disease detection.
Disease Prevention Practices
Scheduled vaccinations (e.g., for Myxomatosis, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease)
Routine deworming
Maintaining optimal housing conditions
Biosecurity Enhancements
Footbaths at cage entry points
Separation of age groups
Controlled access for workers
Nutritional Support
Proper feed formulation to boost immunity
Supplement vitamins and minerals
Health Monitoring & Records

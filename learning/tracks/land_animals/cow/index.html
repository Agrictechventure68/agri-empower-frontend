Cow farming involves the rearing of small ruminants for meat,
    milk, skin, and breeding purposes. These animals are hardy, adaptable to
    various environments, and suitable for extensive, semi-intensive, and
    intensive production systems. Cow play a vital role in
    household income, food security, and rural livelihoods.

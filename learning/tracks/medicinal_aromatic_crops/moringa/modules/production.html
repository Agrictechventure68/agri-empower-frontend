  <p>
    Moringa (<em>Moringa oleifera</em>) is a fast-growing, drought-tolerant
    multipurpose tree cultivated for its leaves, seeds, pods, and roots.
    It performs well in tropical and subtropical regions and adapts to
    diverse farming systems.

  <ul>
    <li>Climate: Warm tropical to semi-arid conditions</li>
    <li>Soil: Well-drained sandy loam to loamy soils</li>
    <li>Propagation: Seeds or stem cuttings</li>
    <li>Spacing: 1 × 1 m (leaf production) or wider for pod production</li>
    <li>Irrigation: Minimal once established</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Moringa can be grown as a
backyard crop, in intensive leaf production
    systems, or as part of agroforestry and mixed farming enterprises.

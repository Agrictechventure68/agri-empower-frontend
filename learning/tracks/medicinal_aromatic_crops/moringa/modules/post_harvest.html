  <h2>Harvesting & Post-Harvest Handling</h2>

  <p>
    Moringa leaves can be harvested 6–8 weeks after planting and
    continuously thereafter. Timely harvesting ensures high nutritional
    quality and regrowth.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Leaves: Hand-harvested or pruned regularly</li>
    <li>Pods: Harvested when young and tender</li>
    <li>Drying: Shade-drying to preserve nutrients</li>
    <li>Storage: Cool, dry, airtight containers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Proper post-harvest handling maintains leaf color, nutrient value,
    and market acceptability.

  <h2>Pest, Disease & Soil Health</h2>

  <p>
    Moringa is relatively resilient to pests and diseases, making it
    suitable for organic and low-input farming systems.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Common pests: Caterpillars, aphids, mites</li>
    <li>Diseases: Root rot and leaf spot under poor drainage</li>
    <li>Control: Field sanitation and biological control</li>
    <li>Soil health: Organic manure, mulching, and compost application</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Good drainage, healthy soils, and proper spacing are the primary
    biosecurity measures for sustainable moringa production.

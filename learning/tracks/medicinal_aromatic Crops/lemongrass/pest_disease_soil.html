  <h2>Pest, Disease & Soil Health</h2>

  <p>
    Lemongrass is relatively resistant to pests and diseases, making it
    suitable for low-chemical and organic farming systems.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Common pests: Grasshoppers, stem borers (minor)</li>
    <li>Diseases: Leaf blight, fungal root rot (under poor drainage)</li>
    <li>Prevention: Proper spacing and drainage</li>
    <li>Soil health: Compost, mulching, crop rotation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Biosecurity measures focus on clean planting materials and
    field sanitation rather than heavy pesticide use.

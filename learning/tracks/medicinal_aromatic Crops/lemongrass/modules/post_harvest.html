  <h2>Harvesting & Post-Harvest Handling</h2>

  <p>
    Lemongrass is harvested 3–4 months after planting and subsequently
    every 6–8 weeks depending on growth conditions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest stage: Before flowering for high oil content</li>
    <li>Method: Cut leaves 10–15 cm above ground</li>
    <li>Drying: Shade-drying for tea and storage</li>
    <li>Storage: Cool, dry, well-ventilated environment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Proper handling preserves aroma, oil yield, and medicinal quality.

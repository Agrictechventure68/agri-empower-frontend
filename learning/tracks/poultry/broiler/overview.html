  <h2>What Is Broiler Farming?</h2>
  <p>
    Broiler farming is the rearing of specially bred chickens for meat
    production within a short growth cycle, typically 5–8 weeks.
    Broilers are selected for rapid weight gain, efficient feed conversion,
    and uniform body size.

  <h2>Broiler Production System</h2>
  <p>
    Broiler production operates as a controlled system involving housing,
    feeding, health management, and environmental regulation. Success depends
    on managing growth stages efficiently while minimizing mortality and cost.

  <h2>Production Cycle Concept</h2>
  <p>
    The broiler cycle moves through distinct phases: chick placement,
    brooding, rapid growth, finishing, and market readiness. Each phase
    requires specific management decisions that affect performance and profit.

  <h2>Business Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    Broiler farming is a volume-driven enterprise. Profitability depends on
    feed efficiency, mortality control, market timing, and cost discipline.
    Farmers may operate independently or under contract farming models.

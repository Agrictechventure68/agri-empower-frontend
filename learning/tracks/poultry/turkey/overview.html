  <h2>What Is Turkey Farming?</h2>
  <p>
    Turkey farming involves the rearing of turkeys primarily for meat
    production. Turkeys are larger birds than chickens, requiring more
    space, longer rearing periods, and specialized management practices.

  <h2>Turkey Production System</h2>
  <p>
    Turkey production typically spans 16–24 weeks depending on breed and
    market target. Management focuses on strong brooding, gradual growth,
    and strict biosecurity due to the birds’ sensitivity at early stages.

  <h2>Production Phases Concept</h2>
  <p>
    Turkey farming progresses through brooding, growing, finishing, and
    processing stages. Each phase requires tailored nutrition, housing,

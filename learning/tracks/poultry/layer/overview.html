  <h2>What Is Layer Farming?</h2>
  <p>
    Layer farming is the rearing of chickens specifically bred for egg
    production. Unlike broilers, layers are managed over a long production
    period, often lasting 60–80 weeks of active laying.

  <h2>Importance of Layer Production</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Continuous supply of affordable animal protein</li>
    <li>Stable income through daily egg sales</li>
    <li>Strong demand across households, bakeries, and industries</li>
    <li>Supports smallholders and commercial farms alike</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Layer Production System</h2>
  <p>
    Layer production operates as a sustained biological system involving
    pullet rearing, sexual maturity, peak egg production, and gradual decline.
    Management focuses on consistency rather than rapid turnover.

  <h2>Production Phases Concept</h2>
  <p>
    The layer enterprise progresses through chick rearing, grower stage,
    point-of-lay, peak production, and late lay. Each phase requires specific
    feeding, lighting, and health strategies.

  <h2>Economic Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    Layer farming is a cashflow-based business. Profitability depends on feed
    cost control, egg quality, mortality management, and reliable market
    access over time.

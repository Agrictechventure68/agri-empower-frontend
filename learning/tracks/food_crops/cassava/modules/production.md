## Production Systems

Cassava can be grown successfully under smallholder and commercial systems.
Most farmers practice rain-fed production, while irrigated systems improve
yield consistency in dry areas.

## Land Preparation & Planting

Select well-drained soils and avoid waterlogged areas. Land should be cleared
and prepared before the onset of rains. Use healthy cassava stems of recommended
varieties and plant at appropriate spacing.

## Farm Management Practices

Regular weeding during the first three months is critical. Apply organic or
recommended fertilizers based on soil condition. Monitor plant growth and
replace weak stands early.

## Common Challenges

Low yields may result from poor planting materials, delayed planting, poor
soil fertility, or inadequate weed control.

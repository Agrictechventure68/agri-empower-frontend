1. INTRODUCTION 
Post-harvest handling and storage are critical stages in watermelon production. Poor handling can lead to 30–50% losses, even after a successful harvest. This module teaches learners how to preserve quality, reduce spoilage, and increase market value across all levels.


2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
2.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Harvest watermelon correctly
* Prevent physical damage
* Understand basic storage needs

2.2 HARVESTING PRACTICES 
* Harvest when fruits are fully mature
* Signs of maturity:
* Yellow spot at ground contact
* Dry tendril near fruit
* Dull (not shiny) skin
* ⚠️ Avoid harvesting too early or too late.

2.3 BASIC Harvest HANDLING 
* Use sharp knives or cutlasses
* Do not throw or roll fruits
Handle gently to avoid bruises

2.4 SHORT-TERM STORAGE (Beginner Level)
* Store in cool, shaded, well-ventilated areas
* Keep fruits off the ground (use pallets or straw)
* Avoid direct sunlight

⏳ STORAGE LIFE: 7–14 days under simple conditions

2.5 COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES 
* Dropping fruits during harvest
* Storing in hot environments
* Washing fruits and storing wet
Outcome: Beginner farmer reduces immediate post-harvest losses.


3. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Improved Handling)
3.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Extend shelf life
* Improve fruit quality
* Reduce spoilage during transport

3.2 SORTING & GRADING 
* Remove damaged or diseased fruits
Grade by:
Size
Shape
Weight
This improves pricing and market trust.

3.3 CLEANING & CURING 
* Dry clean with soft cloth
* If washed, allow fruits to dry completely
* Short curing in shade helps harden skin

3.4 IMPROVED STORAGE CONDITIONS 
* Temperature: 10–15°C
* Relative humidity: 85–90%
* Good air circulation
⏳ Storage life: 2–3 weeks

3.5 TRANSPORTATION PRACTICES 
* Use padded crates or baskets
* Avoid stacking too high
* Transport during cooler hours
Outcome: Intermediate farmer improves market value and reduces losses.

4. ADVANCED LEVEL (Commercial Operations)
4.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Optimize supply chains
* Extend storage duration
* Reduce commercial losses

4.2 COLD STORAGE TECHNIQUES 
* Pre-cool fruits immediately after harvest
MAINTAIN:
* Temperature: 10–12°C
* Humidity: 85–90%
⚠️ Temperatures below 10°C cause chilling injury.

4.3 PACKAGING FOR MARKET 
* Use ventilated plastic crates
LABEL BY:
* Farm name
* Harvest date
* Grade

4.4 LOSS PREVENTION STRATEGIES 
* Regular inspection
* Remove spoiled fruits promptly
* Maintain hygiene in storage facilities
Outcome: Commercial farmer achieves consistent supply and profit.


5. SPECIALIZATION LEVEL (Export & Processing-Oriented)
5.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Meet export quality standards
* Reduce long-distance transport losses
* Maintain premium fruit quality

5.2 EXPORT-GRADE HANDLING 
* Strict grading and size standards
* Sanitized handling equipment
* Traceability documentation

5.3 ADVANCED STORAGE SYSTEMS 
* Controlled atmosphere storage (where available)
* Use of ethylene management practices
* Digital monitoring of temperature and humidity

5.4 FOOD SAFETY & COMPLIANCE 
* Follow food safety protocols
* Train handlers on hygiene
* Use approved storage materials
Outcome: Specialist produces market-ready watermelon for high-value markets.

6. COMMON POST-HARVEST LOSS CAUSES 
* Mechanical injury
* Heat exposure
* Poor ventilation
* Disease spread during storage

7. ENVIRONMENTAL & SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 
* Reuse crates responsibly
*'Dispose damaged fruits properly
* Maintain clean storage areas

8. SUMMARY 
* Proper post-harvest handling:
* Preserves fruit quality
* Extends shelf life
* Increases farmer income
* Reduces food waste

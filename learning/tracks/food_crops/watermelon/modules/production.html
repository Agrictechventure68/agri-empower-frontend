1. INTRODUCTION 
Watermelon is a high-demand fruit crop valued for its nutritional, commercial, and income-generating potential. Successful watermelon production requires good soil management, climate awareness, and proper agronomic practices.


2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
2.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Understand watermelon growth requirements
* Learn basic land preparation and planting
* Harvest marketable fruits

2.2 CLIMATE & SOIL REQUIREMENTS 
* Warm climate (25–35°C)
* Well-drained sandy loam soil
* Soil pH: 5.5 – 7.0

2.3 LAND PREPARATION 
* Clear land and remove debris
* Plough and harrow lightly
*'Form raised beds or ridges

2.4 SEED SELECTION & PLANTING 
* Use improved, disease-free seeds
* Plant directly in the field
SPACING:
* 1–2 seeds per hole
* 1 m × 1.5 m spacing

2.5 WATERING 
* Water immediately after planting
* Maintain moist soil (not waterlogged)

2.6 BASIC FIELD MANAGEMENT 
* Manual weeding
* Simple mulching (dry grass or leaves)

2.7 HARVESTING 
* Harvest 70–90 days after planting
SIGNS OF MATURITY:
* Yellowing of underside
* Dry tendril near fruit
Outcome: Learner can successfully grow watermelon on a small scale.


3. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Improving Yield & Quality)
3.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Increase fruit size and yield
* Reduce losses from pests and diseases
* Improve soil fertility

3.2 IMPROVED VARIETIES 
* Sugar Baby
* Charleston Gray
* Crimson Sweet

3.3 SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT 
* Apply well-decomposed manure
* Use NPK fertilizers based on soil needs
* Side-dress with nitrogen during growth

3.4 IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT 
* Regular watering at flowering and fruiting
* Avoid water stress during fruit formation

3.5 VINE MANAGEMENT 
* Control excessive vine growth
* Turn fruits gently to ensure uniform shape

3.6 WEED & CROP MANAGEMENT 
* Timely hoe weeding
* Mulching to suppress weeds and conserve moisture
Outcome: Learner produces higher yields with improved quality fruits.


4. ADVANCED LEVEL (Commercial Production)
4.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Maximize profit through efficient production
* Manage production at scale
* Reduce production risks

4.2 FIELD LAYOUT & PLANNING 
* Large-scale ridging and bed systems
* Drip irrigation where possible

4.3 FERTILIZER PROGRAM 
* Soil testing and nutrient scheduling
* Balanced NPK application
* Foliar feeding at flowering stage

4.4 POLLINATION MANAGEMENT 
* Encourage bee activity
* Avoid pesticide spraying during flowering

4.5 QUALITY CONTROL 
* Uniform fruit size
* Sugar content (brix) improvement
* Disease-free fruits
Outcome: Learner operates watermelon farming as a commercial enterprise.


5. SPECIALIZATION LEVEL (Expert & Enterprise Production)
5.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Establish professional watermelon farms
* Target premium and export markets
* Integrate technology

5.2 ADVANCED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 
* Hybrid seed cultivation
* Plastic mulch usage
* Controlled irrigation systems

5.3 PROTECTED CULTIVATION 
* Greenhouse or tunnel production (where applicable)
* Off-season production

5.4 DATA & TECHNOLOGY USE 
* Yield monitoring
* Mobile farm record systems
* Precision irrigation

5.5 SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES 
* Crop rotation
* Integrated nutrient management
* Climate-smart agriculture
Outcome: Learner becomes a specialist in watermelon production.

6. COMMON PRODUCTION CHALLENGES 
* Poor fruit setting
* Pest and disease pressure
* Irregular watering
* Soil nutrient imbalance

7. SAFETY & BEST PRACTICES 
* Use certified seeds
* Follow recommended agrochemical dosages
* Maintain field hygiene

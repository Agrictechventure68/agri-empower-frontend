1. INTRODUCTION 
Healthy yam production depends on effective control of pests and diseases, as well as sustained soil fertility. This module builds farmers’ capacity progressively—from basic identification to advanced, data-driven management systems.


2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
2.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
* Identify common yam pests and diseases
* Understand basic soil requirements for yam
* Apply simple prevention measures

2.2 COMMON YAM PESTS 
* Yam beetles – damage tubers underground
* Nematodes – cause tuber cracking and rot
* Rodents – feed on tubers in the field

2.3 COMMON YAM DISEASES 
* Yam mosaic virus – causes leaf mottling
* Anthracnose – leaf and vine damage
* Tuber rot diseases – post-harvest losses

2.4 BASIC SOIL REQUIREMENTS 
* Deep, loose, well-drained loamy soil
* Avoid compacted or waterlogged soils
* Moderate organic matter content

2.5 BASIC PREVENTION & CONTROL PRACTICES 
* Use healthy seed yams
* Practice early field sanitation
* Avoid continuous yam cropping on same land
* Remove and destroy infected plants

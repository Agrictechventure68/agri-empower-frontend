🌾 Rice – Pest, Disease & Soil Health Management


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL
Common Pests
Stem borers
Leaf folders
Grasshoppers
Rice hispa
Common Diseases
Rice blast (Pyricularia oryzae)
Bacterial leaf blight
Sheath blight
Brown spot
Soil Types & Fertility
Well-drained, loamy soils preferred
pH range 5.5 – 6.5
Fertile soils improve plant vigor and yield
Basic Soil Management Practices
Regular addition of organic matter (compost, manure)
Avoid waterlogging to prevent root damage
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Beginners learn to identify pests, common diseases, and basic soil care


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
Pest Management Practices
Field scouting every 7–10 days
Manual removal of pests in small plots
Limited chemical control using recommended pesticides
Disease Prevention Strategies
Planting resistant or tolerant rice varieties
Removing infected plants promptly
Proper field sanitation
Soil Fertility Management
Application of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) based on soil test
Crop rotation with legumes to fix nitrogen
Mulching to conserve moisture
Curriculum Level: Intermediate
Focus: Farmers implement preventive measures and improve soil fertility


🌳 ADVANCED LEVEL
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Combining cultural, biological, and chemical controls
Regular monitoring and threshold-based interventions

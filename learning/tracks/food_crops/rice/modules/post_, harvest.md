🌾 Rice – Post-Harvest Handling & Storage


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL
Harvesting Practices
Harvest rice when grains are mature (yellowing of lower leaves)
Cut plants carefully using sickle or knife
Avoid cutting too early to prevent immature grains
Handling After Harvest
Bundle harvested rice stalks gently
Avoid dropping or trampling bundles
Transport carefully to threshing area
Basic Storage Methods
Sun-dry paddy rice for 3–5 days to reduce moisture
Store in clean, dry, ventilated rooms
Keep away from direct sunlight and rodents
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Beginner farmers learn safe harvest timing, basic handling, and short-term storage


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
Improved Harvesting Techniques
Use mechanized or semi-mechanized harvesters for efficiency
Coordinate harvesting schedule to minimize losses
Post-Harvest Handling
Proper threshing using small threshers or manual methods
Winnowing to separate grain from chaff
Sorting and grading based on grain quality
Storage Improvements
Elevated storage platforms to prevent moisture absorption
Use of woven sacks or clean bins
Periodic inspection for pests and molds
Curriculum Level: Intermediate
Focus: Farmers reduce post-harvest losses and improve grain quality


🌳 ADVANCED LEVEL
Commercial Harvest Planning
Coordinate harvests for industrial buyers or mills
Track moisture content using meters before storage
Plan logistics to reduce time from field to storage
Loss Reduction Strategies
Use mechanical dryers or solar dryers to achieve optimal moisture (12–14%)
Bagging with airtight storage materials for longer preservation
Pest-proof storage facilities
Quality Control
Regular grain inspection for moisture, pests, and molds
Sorting and polishing for market standards
Maintain records of batch storage
Curriculum Level: Advanced
Focus: Large-scale commercial rice post-harvest management and quality control

* Baskets or wooden crates
* Shelf life: 1–2 weeks

* Bruising during harvest
* Fungal infection

KEY LESSON: Gentle handling increases shelf life


2. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL 
* Improved Harvest Techniques
* Harvest during dry weather
* Avoid exposing corms to direct sunlight for long
* Sorting & Grading
SEPARATE:
* Healthy corms
* Damaged or diseased ones
* Grade by size for market value

4. SPECIALIZATION / COMMERCIAL LEVEL 
 
BULK HANDLING & LOGISTICS 
* Use padded crates for transport
* Avoid stacking beyond safe weight limits

VALUE PRESERVATION 
* Cold storage for export markets
* Moisture-controlled storage systems
* Record Keeping
* Harvest dates
* Storage duration
*Loss assessment 

ENTERPRISE FOCUS: Quality retention = higher market value

🌽 Maize – Post-Harvest Handling & Storage

🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL
Harvesting Practices
Harvest maize when husks are dry and kernels are firm
Use hand tools carefully to avoid kernel damage
Early harvesting prevents losses from pests and weather
Handling After Harvest
Avoid dropping cobs or rough handling
Keep harvested maize off the ground
Sort to remove damaged or diseased cobs
Basic Storage Techniques
Store maize in well-ventilated, dry spaces
Use jute or cloth bags for small-scale storage
Protect against rodents and insects
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Beginner farmers learn safe handling, drying, and basic storage


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
Improved Harvesting Techniques
Schedule harvesting for different fields based on maturity
Mechanized shelling for moderate-scale farms
Minimize kernel damage during collection
Post-Harvest Handling
Cleaning, grading, and drying to optimum moisture (~12-14%)
Sorting for quality (remove broken, moldy, or infested cobs)
Use of locally available storage structures (cribs, raised platforms)
Storage Improvements
Insect-proof bags (hermetic storage)
Periodic monitoring of moisture and pest infestation
Rotate stocks to reduce spoilage
Curriculum Level: Intermediate
Focus: Optimizing quality and reducing post-harvest losses

1. Overview
Healthy scent leaf production depends on:
Early pest and disease identification
Good soil structure and fertility
Preventive and integrated management practices
This module equips learners to protect crops at every scale.

2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner / Household)
2.1 COMMON PESTS 
* Aphids – cause leaf curling and yellowing
* Whiteflies – weaken plants and transmit diseases
* Caterpillars – chew leaves

2.2 COMMON DISEASES 
* Leaf spot – brown or black spots on leaves
* Root rot – caused by excess water and poor drainage

2.3 BASIC SOIL HEALTH PRACTICES 
* Use well-drained loamy soil
* Avoid waterlogged areas
* Practice simple crop rotation

2.4 BASIC PREVENTION & CONTROL 
* Hand-picking pests
* Removing diseased leaves
* Adequate spacing for airflow
Curriculum Level: Foundation

3. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Community / SME)
3.1 IMPROVED PEST MANAGEMENT 
* Regular field inspection (scouting)
* Use of botanical sprays (neem extract, pepper solution)
* Yellow sticky traps for flying insects

3.2 DISEASE MANAGEMENT 
* Use of healthy seedlings
* Proper watering schedules
* Field sanitation and removal of infected plants

3.3 SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT 
* Application of compost or poultry manure
* Mulching to reduce erosion and moisture loss
* Basic soil testing to guide nutrient use
Curriculum Level: Intermediate

4. ADVANCED LEVEL (Commercial Production)
4.1 INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)
* Combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods
* Monitoring pest thresholds before spraying
* Use of recommended pesticides when necessary

4.2 ADVANCED DISEASE CONTROL 
* Early disease diagnosis
* Use of resistant varieties
* Controlled irrigation systems to reduce fungal diseases

4.3 ADVANCED SOIL HEALTH MANAGEMENT 
* Soil amendment with lime or gypsum (if needed)
* Organic matter buildup for long-term fertility
* Erosion control practices
Curriculum Level: Advanced

5. SPECIALIZATION LEVEL (Diagnostics & Enterprise Focus)
5.1 SPECIALIZED PEST CONTROL PROGRAMS 
* Farm-specific pest management plans
* Use of biological control agents
* Precision pesticide application

5.2 DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS 
* Field and laboratory disease identification
* Record-based disease trend analysis
* Collaboration with extension services

5.3 SUSTAINABLE SOIL HEALTH SYSTEMS 
* Soil mapping and fertility zoning
* Organic and regenerative soil practices
* Long-term soil productivity planning
Curriculum Level: Specialization

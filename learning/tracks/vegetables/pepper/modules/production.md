Open fields or simple garden beds
Land Preparation
Clear land manually or mechanically
Prepare raised beds or ridges
Remove weeds, stones, and debris
Incorporate organic manure before planting
Nursery Establishment
Use seed trays, baskets, or nursery beds
Sow seeds thinly
Water gently and regularly
Transplant seedlings after 3–4 weeks
Transplanting & Spacing
Transplant in the evening or early morning
Spacing: 45–60 cm between plants
Water immediately after transplanting

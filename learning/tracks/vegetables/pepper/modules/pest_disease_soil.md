🫑 🌶️ Pepper Pest, Disease & Soil Health Management

Effective pest, disease, and soil health management is essential for achieving high yields, good fruit quality, and sustainable pepper production.


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
Common Pests in Pepper
Beginner farmers should be able to identify basic pepper pests.
Aphids – cause leaf curling and yellowing
Thrips – damage young leaves and flowers
Caterpillars – chew leaves and fruits
Whiteflies – cause leaf discoloration and transmit diseases
Common Diseases
Pepper mosaic virus
Leaf spot diseases
Damping-off in nurseries
Bacterial wilt (early symptoms)
Basic Soil Health Awareness
Pepper grows best in loose, well-drained soils
Waterlogged soils encourage root diseases
Continuous cropping reduces soil fertility
Basic Control Measures
Use clean, healthy seedlings
Remove diseased plants early
Practice field hygiene
Avoid overwatering
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focuses on recognition and basic prevention.


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Improving Farmers)
Pest Management Practices
At this level, farmers actively manage pests rather than reacting late.
Regular field scouting
Use of neem-based or botanical pesticides
Timely application of recommended pesticides
Use of insect-proof nursery nets
Disease Prevention Strategies
Use of disease-resistant varieties
Proper plant spacing for airflow
Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops
Nursery sterilization before seed sowing
Soil Fertility Management
Application of organic manure and compost
Balanced fertilizer use (NPK)
Soil testing to guide nutrient application
Weed & Soil Moisture Management
Mulching to conserve moisture
Controlled irrigation
Regular but shallow weeding
Curriculum Level: Intermediate
Emphasizes preventive and improved control methods.


🌾 ADVANCED LEVEL (Commercial & Large-Scale Farming)
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Advanced farmers combine multiple pest control strategies.
Pest monitoring and threshold-based spraying

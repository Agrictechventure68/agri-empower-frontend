1. OVERVIEW 
Post-harvest handling of carrots focuses on maintaining freshness, preventing rot, and preserving root quality. Because carrots are highly perishable, proper harvesting, cleaning, storage, and transportation are critical to reducing losses and increasing market value.


2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
2.1 HARVESTING PRACTICES 
* Harvest carrots at full maturity (bright color, firm roots)
* Avoid over-maturity which causes woody roots
* Harvest during cool hours (early morning or late evening)

2.2 HANDLING AFTER HARVEST 
* Uproot carefully to avoid root breakage
* Remove excess soil gently
* Trim leaves to reduce moisture loss

2.3 BASIC STORAGE METHODS 
* Short-term storage in shaded, cool areas
* Use baskets or ventilated containers
* Keep carrots away from direct sunlight

2.4 LOSS REDUCTION TIPS 
* Avoid bruising during handling
* Sort damaged or diseased roots immediately
* Sell quickly after harvest
Curriculum Level: Foundation


3. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Improved Post-Harvest Practices)
3.1 IMPROVED HARVESTING TECHNIQUES 
* Planned harvesting schedules
* Use of appropriate tools (forks, hoes)
* Gentle washing to remove soil

3.2 SORTING & GRADING 
* Grade by size and quality
* Remove cracked or diseased roots
* Standardize bundles for market

3.3 IMPROVED STORAGE TECHNIQUES 
* Use of simple cold rooms or evaporative coolers
* Storage in perforated plastic crates
* Maintain high humidity to prevent shriveling

3.4 TRANSPORTATION PRACTICES 
* Transport in padded containers

1. OVERVIEW 
Carrot (Daucus carota) is a high-value root vegetable grown for its nutritious taproot. It thrives in cool to moderate climates, well-drained soils, and requires careful soil preparation for quality root development. Carrots are widely consumed fresh, processed, and used in health-focused diets.


2. FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
2.1 PRODUCTION SYSTEMS 
* Small-scale backyard gardens
* Open-field rain-fed production
* Raised beds for home and peri-urban farming

2.2 SITE SELECTION 
* Loose, deep, well-drained sandy loam soils
* Avoid compacted or stony soils
* Full sunlight exposure

2.3 LAND PREPARATION 
* Clear land thoroughly
* Deep tillage (20–30 cm) to loosen soil
* Remove stones, roots, and debris

2.4 PLANTING 
* Direct seeding (no transplanting)
* Row spacing: 25–30 cm
* Thin seedlings to 5–8 cm within rows

2.5 BASIC FARM MANAGEMENT 
* Light but frequent watering
* Manual weeding
* Avoid excessive nitrogen

2.6 COMMON BEGINNER CHALLENGES 
* Forked or deformed roots
* Poor germination
* Weed competition

🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
This level introduces basic disease awareness, simple pest control, and soil care for healthy ugu production.
Common Diseases
Leaf spot disease – causes brown or black spots on leaves
Powdery mildew – white powdery growth on leaves
Damping-off – affects seedlings, causing rotting at soil level
Common Pests
Leaf beetles – chew leaves and reduce yield
Aphids – suck sap and weaken plants
Grasshoppers – cause leaf holes
Basic Soil Health
Ugu grows best in loose, fertile soil
Avoid waterlogged areas
Maintain soil moisture but prevent flooding
Basic Prevention Practices
Use healthy seeds
Remove infected leaves early
Keep farm clean and weed-free
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Focus: Disease recognition and basic prevention

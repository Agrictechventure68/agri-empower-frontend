Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) – Post-Harvest Handling & Storage

🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner)
Harvesting Practices
Pick okra when pods are young, tender, and 5–8 cm long.
Harvest early in the morning to maintain freshness.
Avoid overripe pods as they become fibrous and reduce market value.
Handling After Harvest
Handle pods gently to prevent bruising.
Place in clean baskets or crates, avoid over-stacking.
Wash pods with clean water if needed before market.
Basic Storage
Short-term storage at room temperature for 1–2 days.
Store in a shaded, cool area to reduce heat stress.
Avoid plastic bags that trap moisture and promote decay.
Curriculum Level: Foundation


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
Improved Harvesting Techniques
Harvest pods at regular intervals (every 2–3 days) to maintain continuous production.
Use pruning shears or scissors for clean cuts to avoid damaging plants.
Post-Harvest Handling
Sorting and grading by size and quality before packing.
Cool the produce if possible using shade or cool water immersion.
Minimize handling during transport to avoid bruising.
Storage Enhancements
Store in perforated crates for better air circulation.
Short-term cold storage at 10–12°C can extend shelf life up to 5–7 days.
Use moisture control sheets or clean damp cloths to maintain freshness.
Curriculum Level: Intermediate


🌾 ADVANCED LEVEL
Commercial Harvest Planning

Implement labor management and workflow planning for peak harvest periods.
Loss Reduction Strategies
Rapid post-harvest cooling using evaporative cooling or forced air systems.
Maintain hygiene to prevent fungal or bacterial infections.
Transport in ventilated vehicles to reduce spoilage.
Quality Control
Monitor pod firmness, color, and moisture content.
Remove damaged or diseased pods before storage or shipment.
Use labeling and traceability for commercial supply chains.

Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) – Pest, Disease & Soil Health Management


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner)
Common Pests
Aphids: small green insects that suck sap from leaves and young shoots.
Whiteflies: tiny white insects that cause leaf yellowing and transmit viral diseases.
Caterpillars (like Okra Leaf Roller): chew on leaves and pods.
Common Diseases
Powdery mildew: white powdery growth on leaves.
Fusarium wilt: yellowing and wilting starting from lower leaves.
Leaf spots: small brown or black lesions on leaves.
Soil Basics
Well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils.
Avoid waterlogged areas; okra roots are sensitive to poor drainage.
Maintain moderate organic matter.
Prevention & Basic Control
Remove infested plants and debris.
Use healthy seedlings and good-quality seeds.
Rotate crops to avoid buildup of pests and diseases.
Curriculum Level: Foundation


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
Pest Management Practices
Regular field scouting for early detection.
Use neem-based sprays or approved organic insecticides.
Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings.
Disease Prevention Strategies
Grow resistant okra varieties where available.
Prune infected plant parts promptly.
Maintain proper spacing to reduce humidity and fungal growth.
Soil Fertility Management
Apply well-decomposed compost or farmyard manure.
Conduct soil tests to adjust fertilizer rates (NPK, micronutrients).
Mulching to retain moisture and reduce soil-borne pests.
Curriculum Level: Intermediate


🌾 ADVANCED LEVEL
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Combine cultural, biological, and chemical controls.
Use pheromone traps or sticky traps for monitoring insect populations.
Apply insecticides only when threshold levels are reached.
Advanced Disease Surveillance
Implement a disease monitoring calendar for early detection.
Collaborate with extension services for lab diagnostics.
Apply preventive fungicides based on disease forecasts.
Soil Health Strategies
Crop rotation with legumes to improve nitrogen content.
Deep tillage and soil aeration to prevent compaction.
Regular addition of organic matter to improve structure and water retention.

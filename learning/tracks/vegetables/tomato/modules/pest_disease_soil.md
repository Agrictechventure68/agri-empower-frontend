🍅 Tomato Pest, Disease & Soil Health Management (All Levels)

Healthy tomato production depends on preventive soil management, early pest detection, and integrated disease control.


🌱 FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
Common Tomato Pests
Aphids
Whiteflies
Caterpillars
Leaf miners
Basic Pest Control
Hand-picking of insects
Use of neem extract or wood ash
Clean farm hygiene
Remove and destroy infested plants
Common Diseases
Early blight
Late blight
Damping-off (nursery stage)
Bacterial wilt
Basic Disease Management
Use healthy seedlings
Avoid overcrowding
Water at plant base (not leaves)
Remove infected plants immediately
Soil Health Basics
Use compost or well-rotted manure
Avoid waterlogged soils
Practice simple crop rotation
Focus: Prevention and basic farm hygiene.


🌿 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Growing Farmers)
Major Pests
Thrips
Fruit borers
Whiteflies (virus vectors)
Nematodes
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Regular field scouting
Botanical pesticides (neem oil)
Use of pheromone traps
Selective chemical sprays when needed
Disease Control
Fungal diseases: blight, leaf spot
Viral diseases: Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
Bacterial diseases: soft rot, wilt
Disease Prevention Measures
Disease-resistant varieties
Crop rotation (avoid solanaceous crops)

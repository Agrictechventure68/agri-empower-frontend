1. OVERVIEW 
Bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina) is a perennial leafy vegetable widely cultivated in West and Central Africa. It is valued for nutrition, medicinal properties, and steady market demand. The crop is hardy, adaptable, and suitable for small-scale, commercial, and integrated farming systems.

2. AGRO-ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS 
Climate: Tropical; optimal temperature 20–32 °C
Rainfall: 1,000–2,000 mm annually (supplemental irrigation recommended in dry season)
Soil: Well-drained loamy or sandy-loam soil
Soil pH: 5.5–7.5
Altitude: Sea level to 1,500 m

3. VARIETIES & PLANTING MATERIALS 
Common local ecotypes:
Broad-leaf bitter leaf
Narrow-leaf bitter leaf
Propagation method:
Stem cuttings (most common and reliable)
Recommended cutting size:
Length: 20–30 cm
Nodes: At least 3–5 nodes per cutting

4. LAND PREPARATION 
Foundation Level
Clear land manually
Remove perennial weeds
Light tilling or hoeing
Intermediate Level
Plough and harrow once
Incorporate organic manure (5–10 tons/ha)
Advanced / Commercial Level
Mechanized land preparation
Raised beds or ridges for drainage
Soil testing before planting

5. PLANTING 
Spacing:
50 cm × 50 cm (intensive)
1 m × 1 m (perennial management)
Planting depth: 5–10 cm
Time of planting:
Rainy season preferred
Dry season possible with irrigation
Planting method:
Insert cuttings vertically or slanted
Firm soil around base

6. CROP MANAGEMENT 

6.1 WATER MANAGEMENT 
Regular watering during establishment
Avoid waterlogging
Drip or sprinkler irrigation ideal for commercial farms

6.2 WEED MANAGEMENT 
Manual weeding every 2–4 weeks
Mulching with dry grass or crop residue recommended

6.3 NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT 
Organic:
Poultry manure, compost, farmyard manure
Inorganic (optional):
NPK 15-15-15 at low rates
Top dressing:
Apply after first harvest for regrowth

7. PRUNING & REGENERATION 
First pruning: 6–8 weeks after planting
Cut stems 15–30 cm above ground
Encourages branching and higher leaf yield
Regular pruning every 4–6 weeks

8. HARVESTING 
First harvest: 6–8 weeks after planting
Method:
Cut tender shoots and leaves
Harvest frequency:
Every 4–6 weeks
Economic lifespan:
2–4 years with good management

9. EXPECTED YIELD 
Small scale: 5–8 tons/ha/year
Commercial scale: 10–15 tons/ha/year
Yield depends on soil fertility, pruning frequency, and moisture availability.


10. HEALTH, SAFETY & GOOD PRACTICES 
Use clean tools for cutting
Avoid contaminated water sources
Practice field sanitation
Maintain buffer zones from polluted areas

1. Importance of Proper Post-Harvest Handling
Bitter leaf is highly perishable. Good post-harvest practices:
Preserve freshness and nutritional value
Reduce post-harvest losses
Improve shelf life
Increase market value and consumer acceptance

2. HARVESTING PRACTICES 
2.1 Right Time to Harvest
Harvest early morning or late evening
Avoid harvesting during hot sun
Harvest when leaves are tender and green

2.2 HARVESTING METHODS BY LEVEL 

🟢 Foundation Level
Hand-picking of leaves
Use of clean knives or cutlasses
Avoid tearing or bruising leaves

🟡 Intermediate Level
Harvest young shoots selectively
Use baskets lined with leaves
Train workers on gentle handling

🔵 Advanced Level
Scheduled harvesting cycles
Use of sanitized harvesting tools
Field grading during harvest

3. POST_HARVEST HANDLING 
3.1 Cleaning
Remove damaged or diseased leaves
Rinse lightly with clean water
Drain excess water properly

3.2 Sorting & Grading
Sort by leaf size and freshness
Separate leaves for:
Fresh consumption
Processing
Animal feed (low-grade leaves)

4. STORAGE TECHNIQUES 
4.1 Short-Term Storage (Fresh Leaves)

🟢 Foundation Level
Wrap leaves in banana leaves
Keep in cool, shaded place
Sprinkle water lightly to retain moisture
Shelf life: 1–2 days

🟡 Intermediate Level
Store in perforated plastic bags
Refrigeration at 5–10°C
Moist storage crates
Shelf life: 3–5 days

🔵 Advanced Level
Cold storage with humidity control (90–95%)

Hygienic storage facilities
Shelf life: 7–10 days

5. TRADITIONAL PRESERVATION METHODS 
5.1 Sun Drying
Wash and slice leaves
Dry under mild sun
Store in airtight containers
Used mainly for:
Soup ingredients
Medicinal purposes

5.2 Shade Drying (Preferred)
Preserves color and nutrients better
Less bitterness increase

6. HANDLING LOSS PREVENTION MEASURES

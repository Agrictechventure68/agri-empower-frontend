1. Importance of Pest, Disease & Soil Management

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT:
Improves leaf quality and yield
Extends the productive life of the plant
Reduces bitterness caused by stress
Ensures food safety and market acceptance

2. MAJOR PESTS OF BITTER LEAF 
2.1 Common Pests
Pest
Damage Caused
Aphids
Leaf curling, stunted growth
Caterpillars
Leaf holes and defoliation
Grasshoppers
Severe leaf loss
Leaf beetles
Skeletonized leaves
Termites (early stage)
Cutting young stems

2.2 PEST MANAGEMENT BY LEVELS 
🟢 Foundation Level
Hand-picking of insects
Use of ash or neem leaf extract
Intercropping with scent leaf or basil
Early morning or evening monitoring

🟡 Intermediate Level
Neem oil spray (2–3 ml/L)
Soap solution for aphids
Regular field scouting (weekly)
Use of light traps for night insects

🔵 Advanced Level
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Biological control (beneficial insects)
Selective bio-pesticides
Pest threshold–based spraying

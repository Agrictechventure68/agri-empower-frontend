Cucumber (🥒) Pest, Disease & Soil Health Management


FOUNDATION LEVEL (Beginner Farmers)
Common Pests
Cucumber crops are commonly attacked by:
Aphids
Whiteflies
Cucumber beetles
Thrips
These pests feed on plant sap or leaves, causing weak growth and reduced yield.
Common Diseases
Common cucumber diseases include:
Powdery mildew
Downy mildew
Damping-off (in seedlings)
Mosaic virus diseases
Diseases often spread through infected seeds, water splash, or insect vectors.
Basic Soil Health Requirements
Well-drained soil to prevent root diseases
Avoid waterlogged fields
Loose soil for good root development
Basic Prevention Practices
Use healthy seeds
Remove diseased plants early
Keep the farm clean and weed-free
Practice crop rotation
Curriculum Level: Foundation
Designed to help farmers recognize problems early and apply simple preventive measures.


INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Improved Crop Protection)
